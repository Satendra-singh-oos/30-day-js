Day 2: Operators
Tasks/Activities:

Activity 1: Arithmetic Operations
â€¢ Task 1: Write a program to add two numbers and log the result to the console.
â€¢ Task 2: Write a program to subtract two numbers and log the result to the console.
â€¢ Task 3: Write a program to multiply two numbers and log the result to the console.
â€¢ Task 4: Write a program to divide two numbers and log the result to the console.
â€¢ Task 5: Write a program to find the remainder when one number is divided by another and log the result to the console.

Activity 2: Assignment Operators
â€¢ Task 6: Use the += operator to add a number to a variable and log the result to the console.
â€¢ Task 7: Use the -- operator to subtract a number from a variable and log the result to the console.

Activity 3: Comparison Operators
â€¢ Task 8: Write a program to compare two numbers using > and < and log the result to the console.
â€¢ Task 9: Write a program to compare two numbers using >= and <= and log the result to the console.
â€¢ Task 10: Write a program to compare two numbers using == and === and log the result to the console.

Activity 4: Logical Operators
â€¢ Task 11: Write a program that uses the && operator to combine two conditions and log the result to the console.
â€¢ Task 12: Write a program that uses the operator to combine two conditions and log the result to the console.
â€¢ Task 13: Write a program that uses the ! operator to negate a condition and log the result to the console.

Activity 5: Ternary Operator
â€¢  Task 14: Write a program that uses the ternary operator to check if a number is positive or negative and log the result to the console.

Feature Request:
1. Arithmetic Operations Script: Write a script that performs basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, remainder) on two numbers and logs the results.
2. Comparison and Logical Operators Script: Create a script that compares two numbers using different comparison operators and combines conditions using logical operators, logging the results. 3. Ternary Operator Script: Write a script that uses the ternary operator to determine if a number is positive or negative and logs the result.
3. Ternary Opreation Script : Write  a script that uses the ternary operation to detarmine is number is postive or negative and logs the result 
Achievement:
By the end of these activities, students will:
â€¢ Understand and use arithmetic operators to perform basic calculations.
â€¢ Use assignment operators to modify variable values.
â€¢ Compare values using comparison operators.
. Combine conditions using logical operators.
â€¢ Use the ternary operator for concise conditional expressions.
